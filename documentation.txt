connection is opened on constructor call //subject to change, could make it a separate connection method

class name is URTCP

gripperRead() immediately returns a string corresponding to the contents of the TCP buffer

gripperWrite(string) immediately writes to the URscript when its awaiting input. this method is not meant to be called directly.

gripperContinue() signals to the URrobot that it may continue, to be used for example when the robot wishes to grip an object, this should then be called once the grip is complete as measured by the raspberry pi

gripperTerminate() terminates the connection



on the urscript side we have

initGripper() which is ran on robot boot and connects to the TCP server on the raspberry pi

gripperWait() is a function only to be used within other functions. it waits for a gripperContinue() signal to know its task has been completed

msgRecv() is a function to receive a message, only used in gripperWait as of current

msgSend(message) is a function to send any message to the tcp server raspberry pi. should not be used, instead socket sends have been implemented directly in sending functions

exit() sends a signal to shut down the tcp server socket // not currently implemented on the server raspberry pi

gripperSet(amount) signals to the server to position the gripper at a certain percentage (input 0-100 measured in %)

gripperOpen() signals to the server to position the gripper at 100, that is, completely open

gripperGrip() signals to the server to position the gripper at a gripped position

gripperClose() signals to the server to position the gripper at 0, that is, completely closed
